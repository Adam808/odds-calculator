This is a simple odds calculator that lets you compare the odds you are being offered on a bet with
what you believe the true odds are. It has options to enter odds as a probability, American odds, or
fractional odds. Finally, you input your bankroll. It then returns what percentage of your bankroll
to bet based on the Kelly criterion.
